# Project Context: Layoffs Prediction

## Objectives
*   Focus heavily on the **Modeling** phase of the data science lifecycle.
*   Use the `tidymodels` framework (recipes, parsnip, workflows, yardstick).
*   Ensure data splitting (training/testing) is done correctly.

## Instructions
1.  Load the data.
2.  Clean missing values and encode categorical variables.
3.  Split the data into training and testing sets.
4.  Create a recipe for preprocessing.
5.  Train a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
6.  Evaluate performance on the test set.
