# Project Context: Layoffs Forecast

## Objectives
*   Focus on **Time Series** concepts.
*   Understand the difference between standard dataframes and `tsibble` objects.
*   Evaluate forecast accuracy using time-based splitting (e.g., train on 2022-2023, test on 2024).

## Instructions
1.  Aggregate layoff data by Month/Week.
2.  Convert to `tsibble` and check for gaps.
3.  Visualize the time series (decomposition).
4.  Fit a benchmark model (Naive) and a complex model (ETS/ARIMA).
5.  Compare models and visualize the forecast.
